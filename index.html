        <h4>Who <span>I am</span> </h4>
        <p>
            I'm Brazilian living in Manchester since 2019. I have four years of experience
            with Application Development, Continuous Improvement and Process
            Analysis. What I like most about my work is working with problem solving, architecture and creating
            solutions that will facilitate the end user's daily life.

        <h4>My <span>Career Story</span></h4>
        <p>
            I started my career with IT in 2016, at Cargill working with application
            development in VB and VBA using MS Access as database for a small
            accounting team and my role there was to understand the process that the
            team did, design the solutions, develop the applications and test them.
        </p>
        <p>
            After 6 months the team's management became interested in the work I was
            doing and expanded it so that I could start meeting other supervisor
            within the same accounting tower. That's when I saw the need to start
            working with more robust databases like Microsoft SQL and more robust programing language like C#. As I
            worked in a Shared Services Center that was expanding, the continuous
            improvement team was also growing and was asking for a list of my
            projects, so in 2017 I was promoted to Perfomance Analyst and started
            doing projects for all of Cargill in Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>
            That same year, Cargill start working with robots and the Shared Services
            Center in Brazil was chosen to be the pilot. One of my projects done in VBA was
            chosen for this type of automation and I was one of the developers
            chosen to start working with RPA and I develop different types of bots across Cargill.
        </p>
        <p>
            In March 2019, I was invited to
            participate in a selection process for a project to implement RPA at
            Algar Tech, a large South American technology company and saw a good
            opportunity for growth. Where we were responsible for creating the company's first robots and defining tools
            and best practices

        <h4>Why <span>Back?</span> </h4>
        <p>
            When the opportunity arose to move to a new country, I had to relearn many things, including talking, so my
            initial focus was on learning English. After that, I felt the need to restructure my career based on what I
            most enjoyed doing. So I came to the conclusion that what I like most is programming and development. It was
            where between my studies, I discovered Tech Returns the course would fit exactly in what I would like to
            learn and improve.

        </p>
        <p>
            Returning to the job market with all my knowledge provides more knowledge acquired in
            Tech Returns will give me the feeling of a new beginning and new opportunities. Returning to the market will
            bring my independence back.
